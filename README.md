We got the vulnerabilties from:

For each vulnerability, we take the vulnerability details, cvss score, and cve id

We take the info, break it down into smaller text chunks, and embed them as vector embeddings

Then, when the user inputs a code snippet, we use LangChain's features and the OpenAI API to return the most likely vulnerabilty in the code
