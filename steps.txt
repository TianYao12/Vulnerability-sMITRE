# we need to go through each vulnerability on https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?form_type=Basic&results_type=overview&search_type=all&isCpeNameSearch=false
# click on each one and go on the github page
# then scrape the github page 
# then embedd the text as vector embeddings and have metadata to identify each vulnerability?
